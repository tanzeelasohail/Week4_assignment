        <h2><div class="subHeading"> What Is Nature?</div></h2>
        
        <p>An exploration of nature as a concept and as a reality can be organized in many different ways. Yet if a decisive break can be found in the history of the human understanding and perception of nature, is the one represented by Darwinism. It makes sense then to take it as the turning point in the history of the concept.</p>
        
        <p>After an initial reflection on the very notion of ‘naturalness’, this
chapter will trace the origins of the term in Ancient Greece and will then follow
its semantic mutations throughout history, a conceptual development that run
parallel to human-induced material transformations in nature. From the Greeks to
Escholastics, from the Renaissance to Descartes and Bacon, an overview of how
nature was conceived before the advent of Darwinism is offered, before the latter
itself is presented.
        </p>
        
        <p> Darwin’s legacy is considered, including the new conception of human nature that derives from it and the rise of ecology as a scientific discipline that is concerned with nature as an harmonious and dynamic system of particular relations. Other, non-Western views of nature are also considered, a survey that poses an uncomfortable question: the discrepancy between respectful ideals of the human-nature relation that do not translate into peaceful human practices.</p>
